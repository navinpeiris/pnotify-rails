# Pines Notify for Rails

Pines Notify is a JavaScript notification plugin, developed by Hunter Perrin as part of Pines. It is designed to provide an unparalleled level of flexibility, while still being very easy to implement and use.

See the [PNotify home page](http://sciactive.com/pnotify/) for more information and examples.

## Requirements

See the [PNotify Github page](https://github.com/sciactive/pnotify#requirements) for more details.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pnotify-rails'

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:
